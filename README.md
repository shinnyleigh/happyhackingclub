Happy Hacking Club  
================  

Resources to be used for study and practice. These will be the main resources we use collectively going forward. New resources will be added when we deem them necessary.  

Learning:  
Part 1. JavaScript: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript  
Part 2. jQuery: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery  
Part 3. Node.js: http://nodeschool.io/  
  
Collab IDE:  
Nitrous: https://www.nitrous.io/  
Please feel free to create your own private Nitrous IDE but we'll use this one to collaborate. We'll use collab mode with each other's IDEs in order to assist but we'll use our own private IDEs in order to fork the shared codebase and make modifications.  
  
Practice:   
- http://jsfiddle.net/ or http://regex101.com/#javascript  
- http://www.codewars.com/  
- https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/git
